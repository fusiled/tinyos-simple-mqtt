1.Connection
	Node sends a CONNECT, PAN replies with a CONNACK

2.Subscribe:
	3 possible topics: TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, LUMINOSITY.
	Node sends a SUBSCRIBE to PAN, containing ID and TOPICS. 
	For each topic a QoS={0,1} (QoS0=at most once, QoS1=at least once).
	PAN replies with a ACK.
3.Publish:
	send a PUBLISH to PAN. PUBLISH has the fields: topic_name, payload and QoS.
4.QoS management:
	like in MQTT each message is subject to two levels of QoS. 
	For PUBLISH messages, the QoS controls the transmission from  node to PAN.
	The Qos defined by the transmitting node is replicated from PAN to other nodes.
